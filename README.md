### Description:
Data validator is a library that can be used to check the correctness of any data. There are many similar libraries in every language, since almost all programs work with external data that needs to be checked for correctness. First of all, we are talking about data from forms filled out by users. The project is based on the [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) library.
